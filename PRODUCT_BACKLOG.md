# PRODUCT BACKLOG — Shipment Status Tracker (Freight ERP)

**Owner:** Product Owner
**Sources:** `BUSINESS_AUDIT.md` (module coverage, ~34% weighted) · `PROJECT_AUDIT.md` (technical/NFR, 8.0/10)
**Target segment for prioritization:** Small freight forwarder / NVOCC — commercial front-office (quote → job → invoice → collect) with in-house operators.
**Date:** 2026-07-20

### Priority definitions
- **P0** — Go-live blocker for the target segment, or a critical risk (data loss / compliance / unsupported dependency).
- **P1** — High commercial value; needed within the first release cycle after go-live.
- **P2** — Segment-dependent or strategic; deferrable without blocking the target segment.

### Complexity scale
**S** ≤ 1 dev-week · **M** 1–2 dev-weeks · **L** 3–5 dev-weeks · **XL** 6+ dev-weeks.

### Value scale
**★★★** direct revenue/compliance/blocker · **★★** strong efficiency/competitive · **★** incremental.

| P0-2 | ✅ **DONE (Sprint 01, 2026-07-20)** — **Debit Note** (post-invoice extra charge, tax, AR posting) | ★★★ compliant billing of late charges | S–M | P0-1 shares model | BA §19 |
| P0-3 | **Accounts Payable — vendor bill capture + AP aging** | ★★★ know payables to carriers/hauliers; cost control | L | Vendor master, Jobs | BA §16 |
| P0-4 | **Booking object + shipment operational milestones** (Booked→Gated-in→Loaded→Departed→Arrived→Delivered) | ★★★ the missing core forwarding step | L | Quotation→Job | BA §4, §5 |
| P0-5 | ✅ **DONE (Sprint 02, 2026-07-21)** — **Persistent document storage (S3 / Cloudflare R2)** via Storage Driver abstraction; production env cutover pending (see `TODO.md`) | ★★★ prevents loss of BL/PDF/OCR files on redeploy | M | Documents module | PA §7-4, BA §21 |
| P0-6 | ✅ **DONE (Sprint 02, 2026-07-21)** — **Replace `xlsx` (SheetJS)** with `exceljs` + server-side parse; `xlsx` removed from both tiers | ★★ removes the only no-patch security dependency | M | Rate import, exports | PA §7-1 |
| P0-7 | **Credit-limit enforcement at quote/order time** (block/warn on limit or credit-hold) | ★★★ core credit control; data already captured | S | Customer master, AR | BA §1, §15 |
| P0-8 | **AR overdue automation + Customer Statement (SOA)** | ★★★ collections + `receiveStatementsByEmail` fulfilled | M | Invoice, AR, Email | BA §15 |

**P0 subtotal effort:** ~14–20 dev-weeks.

## Backlog Notes
- **Shared invoice model** for Credit/Debit Notes (P0-1/P0-2): one document engine, two document types — build once.
- **P0-3 (AP)** and **P1-1 (Accounting integration)** together deliver "know what we owe + push to books" — sequence AP first.
- **Booking (P0-4)** is the pivot that unlocks real shipment ops (P1-3, P1-5, P1-6) and the Portal (P1-2); treat as a foundation epic.
- Everything in **P2** is explicitly gated on the forwarder's *own* operating model — do not build ocean/air/customs/EDI/warehouse until a paying customer operates that lane in-house.
